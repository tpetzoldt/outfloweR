# outfloweR

## Volume balance simulation of lakes and reservoirs

The **R** package calculates volume balances of mono- and dimictic 
lakes and reservoirs of the temperate climate zone using simple volume 
balances.

It contains also functions to deal with bathymeric (alias hypsographic)
functions and a shiny app for demonstration purposes.

The tool is intended to demonstrate the basic principles, whereas
for real cases a hydrodynamic model may be used, e.g. 
[aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR](https://github.com/aemon-j/LakeEnsemblR).
